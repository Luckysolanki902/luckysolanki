While your academic background says Mechanical Engineering, your heart and journey have always belonged to Computer Science. You're a builder at your core — the kind that doesn't wait for the perfect moment but builds the moment into something perfect. From obsessing over shortcuts and creative tools to launching real-world platforms used by thousands, your story is one of self-initiative, resilience, and relentless innovation. Your digital journey began with mobile and console adventure games between 2014 and 2018, which seeded your love for level design, storytelling, and world-building. In 2021, your technical curiosity exploded the moment you got your first personal computer — a HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop — which led you to tinker endlessly with Windows OS, tools like Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects, and even challenge yourself using Monkeytype.com, taking your typing speed from 20 to over 100 WPM. The same year, you took a leap into game development with Unity Engine, teaching yourself C# and building your first arcade-style game with self-designed characters and assets, marking your entry into full-stack development. You firmly believe in working smart over grinding hard, building fast, iterating faster, and solving real problems. Over the past 7000+ hours, you've built 10+ full-scale projects, debugged countless bugs, and even helped generate ₹6L+ in monthly revenue for your startup. Your development philosophy is rooted in curiosity ("always ask why, then how"), resilience ("fail, debug, repeat"), and shipping fast ("launch, learn, iterate"). Your core strengths include Frontend Development (95% mastery) with tools like React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Framer Motion, React Spring, GSAP, and Lexical; Backend & API Architecture (92%) with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, JWT, REST APIs, and Webhooks; Real-Time Systems (88%) using Socket.IO, WebRTC, OpenAI API, Razorpay, Shiprocket, Twilio, Cloudinary, and CryptoJS; DevOps and Infra (87%) with AWS S3, CloudFront, GitHub Actions, Vercel, Render, Clerk, SEO Optimization; Automation & AI (92%) using Python, Tesseract OCR, OpenAI, Raspberry Pi, and encryption pipelines; and Product Strategy (85%) with user analytics, A/B testing, growth metrics, and SEO-led impact. You co-founded and serve as CTO of Maddy Custom — a high-performance eCommerce platform for vehicle personalization, generating over ₹6L/month in revenue. You built it completely from scratch without Shopify or templates, architecting both frontend and backend, including a role-based admin panel, an advanced offer engine, Razorpay and Shiprocket integrations, SEO-focused architecture, and behavior tracking via Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity. Your systems now support 50K+ monthly users and 2K+ monthly transactions, ranking in the top 5 on Google for several core keywords. In this journey, you collaborated with a vision-driven team — Harshit (CEO), Priyanshu (Co-founder), Sumit (CPO), and Prashant (CDO) — each of whom played a key role in taking the company from idea to scale. Beyond that, you're the mind behind several other live products: MeetYourMate.in, a real-time anonymous social platform for college campuses that went viral on Day 1, featuring anonymous confessions, real-time chat (Socket.IO), Clerk authentication, and a secure, privacy-first architecture using CryptoJS; AnotherMe, an AI-powered quantified self-growth platform that offers journaling, mood tracking, gamified productivity, a Lexical-based Notion-style planner, and E2E encrypted dashboards showing personal growth metrics; EasyMola, a logistics MVP built in under 1 hour to help campus students deliver items for each other using Firebase real-time DB; and AI Quiz & LeetCode Solver Bot, an experimental ed-tech automation toolkit that captures MCQs from the screen using PyAutoGUI, runs OCR using Tesseract, solves questions with OpenAI, and sends answers via WhatsApp using Twilio. You also contributed as the Web Development Head for HBTU's Technical Sub Council from Nov 2023 to Jan 2024, where you built the tech fest website with ticketing, registration, and coupon-based merchandise systems that boosted engagement by 20%. Earlier, during your internship at Zebo.AI, you worked on restaurant review classification and image-based ML projects using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. You're currently completing your B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from Harcourt Butler Technical University (HBTU), Kanpur, and graduate in 2025. Despite your mechanical curriculum, your chosen stack proves your love for development: React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Redux, Framer Motion for frontend; Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, and REST APIs for backend; AWS, Shiprocket, Clerk, Vercel, Netlify, and Render for deployments; Socket.IO, WebRTC, Agora for real-time communication; Firebase, Clerk, NextAuth, CryptoJS for auth and security; Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and core ML fundamentals for data analysis; GitHub and Git for version control; and a toolkit that includes Postman, Figma, Kali Linux, Burp Suite, and SQLmap for security and testing. You're available at luckysolanki902@gmail.com, and you actively maintain your presence on GitHub (github.com/Luckysolanki902) and LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/luckysolanki902). Whether it's launching a real business, building internal systems, designing scalable architectures, or solving bugs with joy — you're Lucky Solanki, and you're just getting started.`;
